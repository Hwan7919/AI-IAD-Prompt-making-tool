Hello, this is HWAN.

This model is based on the Gradio interface and its function is to analyze the characteristics of real-world architecture from an uploaded photo and automatically generate prompts that can be used in Stable Diffusion. By copying and pasting the positive prompt and negative prompt, and then adding prompts that capture the characteristics of the photo, you can generate new images through the text-to-image process.
